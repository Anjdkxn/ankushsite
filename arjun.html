	<h1>HTML Introduction</h1>
	<h2>What is <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr></h2>
	<p>HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. This means it uses tags to annotate text and define how it should be displayed by web browsers. 
	It is the foundation of the web, providing the structure and content for virtually all websites. 
	HTML uses tags like to define elements such as paragraphs, headings, and hyperlinks.</p>
	<H1>HTML Working</H1>
	<P>HTML documents are text files with a .html extension.
	Browsers read these files and interpret the HTML tags to render the content on the screen.
	HTML provides the basic structure and content of a webpage, while CSS handles the visual presentation (styling) and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior. </P>

	<h1>What is an z <acronym></acronym> Document</h1>
	<p>A typical HTML document has a hierarchical structure, often consisting of a <html> element containing a <head> and a <body>. 
	This is the root element of the document, containing all other elements. 
	<head> Element:
	Contains meta-information about the document, like the title (displayed in the browser tab). 
	<body> Element:
	Contains the visible content of the webpage, including text, images, videos, etc. </p>
	<h1>HTML Elements and Tags</h1>
	<p>Examples of HTML elements include <p> (paragraph), <h1> to <h6> (headings), <a> (links), <img> (images), <div> (division/section), and many more. Each element has a start tag (e.g., <p>) and an end tag (e.g., </p>), though some elements like <img> can be self-closing (e.g., <img src="image.jpg">). </p>
	<h1>HTML version timeline</h1>
	<h2>HTML 2</h2>
	<H3>November 24,1995</H3>
	<p>HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:
	November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)
	May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)
	August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)
	January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)</p>
	<h2>HTML 3</h2>
	<H3>January 14, 1997</H3>
	<p>HTML 3.2[16] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[17]
	Initially code-named "Wilbur",[18] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.[14] A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML</p>
